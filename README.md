# Weather-App
This Python-based weather application provides real-time meteorological data by integrating two powerful APIs—OpenWeatherMap and Open-Meteo—within a user-friendly graphical interface built using Tkinter. Designed for simplicity and responsiveness, the app allows users to input a location and instantly retrieve current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more. By leveraging the strengths of both APIs, it ensures accurate and comprehensive weather insights, while Tkinter offers a lightweight GUI framework ideal for desktop deployment. This project showcases how external data sources can be seamlessly combined with Python’s native tools to create practical, interactive applications.
